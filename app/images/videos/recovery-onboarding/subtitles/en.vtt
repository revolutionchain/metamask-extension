00:07.583 --> 00:10.266
Traditional online services that require credit cards

00:10.333 --> 00:14.500
and other types of payment processes are centralized

00:14.500 --> 00:17.633
We call this Web 2.0 

00:17.633 --> 00:20.000
Web 3.0 allows the end user

00:20.000 --> 00:22.966

00:22.966 --> 00:26.483
of privacy compared to traditional e-commerce

00:26.883 --> 00:30.333
service providers can now charge for their products 

00:30.350 --> 00:32.300
using crypto currencies 

00:32.300 --> 00:35.000
while cutting out the middleman completely 

00:35.166 --> 00:38.466
In order to facilitate these transactions consumers

00:38.750 --> 00:43.400
like yourself use digital wallets capable of storing and spending

If you're new to Web 3.0

01:09.683 --> 01:13.383
it's important to understand that holding the keys to your own 

01:13.383 --> 01:15.433
crypto currency comes with some risk

01:15.916 --> 01:17.866
 there's no support number you

01:17.866 --> 01:20.633
can call if you lose access to your wallet

01:21.033 --> 01:24.533
This is why it's very important to take the necessary steps

01:24.700 --> 01:27.850
to secure your digital wallet because whoever controls

01:27.850 --> 01:31.300
the private keys to the wallet controls the funds

01:32.166 --> 01:36.166

01:36.166 --> 01:37.433
the new users

01:37.433 --> 01:40.583
so for simplicity sake they are represented by

01:40.583 --> 01:44.683

01:55.983 --> 02:00.466
with anyone online even if the website looks legitimate

02:00.466 --> 02:04.333
it may just be trying to lure you into giving access to your coins 

02:04.333 --> 02:09.366
There are many products available for safe storage of these keys

02:09.366 --> 02:11.333
but just remember to write down

02:11.333 --> 02:15.000
multiple copies of these words and keep them private

02:15.350 --> 02:18.583
